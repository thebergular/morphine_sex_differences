!!! WARNINGS !!!
Warning! Zero-zero ratio too high - The ratio between zero-zero pixels and other pixels is large: 0.45. Maybe you should use a ROI.
Warning! y-intercept far from zero - The ratio of the y-intercept of the auto threshold regression line to the mean value of Channel 2 is high. This means the y-intercept is far from zero, implying a significant positive or negative zero offset in the image data intensities. Maybe you should use a ROI. Maybe do a background subtraction in both channels. Make sure you didn't clip off the low intensities to zero. This might not affect Pearson's correlation values very much, but might harm other results.
Warning! Threshold of ch. 1 too high - Too few pixels are taken into account for above-threshold calculations. The threshold is above the channel's mean.
Warning! thresholds too low - The auto threshold method could not find a positive threshold, so thresholded results are meaningless.
